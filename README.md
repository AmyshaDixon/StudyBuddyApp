# StudyBuddyApp
A bare-bones partial for android programing practice in CPW 252. StudyBuddyApp contains placeholder images obtained from a Google search
and do not belong to the StudyBuddyApp author. StudyBuddy app was meant to be a study time planner with a "study buddy" animal widget that
timed each study session. App currently has a database and general application stucture, but no full calender or selection functionality;
images are eventually meant to be repalced with original content.
